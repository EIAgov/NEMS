 This is your PROFILE, which is set now just to give you these messages.
 You should change PROFILE.EXC to set parameters, like SCREEN, or to
 execute commands for some particular exercises.

 You may peruse *.EXC files to see some ANALYZE execution files.  In
 particular, you can obtain filed documentation (for printing as hard copy)
 by typing:  EXEC DOCANAL (and you might change this to suit your needs).
 Be sure to EXEC ATEST before setting up your own PROFILE.

 Also, you might create SETUP.EXC, which sets default prefixes and suffixes
 for files (as with the _SETUP command), even before the PROFILE is
 executed.  You, or your constituents, might also EXEC SETUP0 to restore file
 default specs, so please look at that file too.

 See the User Guide for other special files that initialize the session
 environment.

 This file is FIRSTIME.DOC, which was PRINTed from PROFILE.EXC, which
 was installed.  You should now delete (or edit) PROFILE.EXC to avoid this
 message in the future.

    Most of the ASCII input files recognize an INCLUDE statement.  In an
    execution file, this allows execution of another file of commands and
    continuation with the main one (but the RETURN statement still
    returns to the terminal).  The only restrictions are:

      1.  The keyword INCLUDE must begin in column 1, followed by the
          INCLUDE file specification.

      2.  Only one INCLUDE file can be active - that is, you cannot
          have an INCLUDE specification within another one.

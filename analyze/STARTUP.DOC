                   SETUP ASSOCIATED WITH START-UP PROCESS

    This is to explain the use of keyworded files for initializing the
    session.  ANALYZE looks for the following files (in order).

      RULBASE.RUL
           If this exists, it defines the options in the INTERPRT
           command.  Each entry is a rule file name (1 line @), and
           the file's existance is tested before it is added as an
           option.

      SETUP.EXC
           If this exists, it sets prefixes and suffixes for the
           intrinsic filetypes given in _SETUP

                                    NOTE
    All files below are sought with the default prefix and suffix, which
    may have been changed by SETUP.EXC.

      CREDITS.DOC
           If this exists, it is printed before the sign-on.  You may
           delete or rename it to suppress printing at every session.

      ANALYZE.DIC
           If this exists, this dictionary is loaded.

      PROFILE.EXC
           If this exists, it executes the commands in it.  This is where
           one can set strings (for simple abbreviations of common
           specifications), screen width/length, readin an LP, give
           message to user, etc.

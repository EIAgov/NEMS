                        ANALYZE Syntax File Structure

    The syntax file for ANALYZE is as follows.  There are 3 segments:
    entity sets (used for domains), rows and columns.  Throughout the
    file an astrisk (*) may be used in column 1 to have a comment line,
    which is ignored.  The sets segment has no header and must appear
    first.  Its form is:

                          _________________________
                         | name meaning            |
                         |     member meaning      |
                         |         ...             |
                         | ...                     |
                         |_________________________|

    The name of the set appears first, and it must be in column 1.
    Members, if present, appear indented (at least 1 leading blank).
    This is repeated until all sets have been defined.

    The second segment begins with the keyworded line:

                            ROW SYNTAX  [comment]

    which must be caps and start in column 1.  The last segment begins
    with the keyworded line:

                           COLUMN SYNTAX [comment]

    and must also begin in column 1 with caps.  The comments in both
    keyworded lines are optional, and they are ignored.

    Following these segments are the syntax maps of the form:

                       name = text with set references

    The name is the row or column "class," exclusive of domain; and, the
    set references are delimeted by the ampersand (&).  The set reference
    has the form:

                            &name:number[/number]

    The name is the set name, already defined, and the first number
    (delimited by the colon) is the beginning of the field position in
    the row or column name.  If the second number is present, it is the
    last position of the field; otherwise, the default length of the
    field is the length of the set name.

    For example, see the .SYN files that came with ANALYZE.  In
    particular, note that WOODNET.SYN contains the following.

          |     LA Los Angeles                        |
          |     SE Seattle                            |
          | ROW SYNTAX                                |
          |   S  balances supply of &MT:2 in &LO:4    |
          |   D  balances demand of &MT:2 in &LO:4    |
          | COLUMN SYNTAX                             |
          |   S  supplies &MT:2 in &LO:4              |
          |   D  demands  &MT:2 in &LO:4              |
          |   T  transports &MT:2 from &LO:4 to &LO:6 |
          |___________________________________________|

    The ROW SYNTAX has two classes:  Those that begins with S and those
    that begin with D.  The set reference &MT:2 says that the material
    set member (MT) begins in position 2 of the name and has 2 characters
    (length of MT).  The set of rows has the domain form S(MT,LO), and
    the LP name for the row that balances supply of pine in Denver is
    SPIDE.

    The reference &MT:2/3 is equivalent to &MT:2 since the length of set
    MT is 2 characters.

    The objective row need not be entered in the rows segment, as it will
    be given the special meaning of minimand or maximand (if a meaning is
    given, it is ignored for the EXPLAIN and SYNTAX commands).

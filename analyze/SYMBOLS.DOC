                                Special Symbols

    The following table shows special symbols used for the commands and for
    some output.  These should be avoided in naming rows and columns of the
    LP.

      comma         ,  delimiter of tokens
      parentheses  ()  delimiter of tokens
      braces       {}  delimiter of tokens
      semi-colon    ;  delimiter of lines of input
      single quote  '  delimiter for a string

      --------------------------------------------------------------------

    A delimiter is a symbol used in parsing a line of input;  it separates
    tokens, like commands and parameter names.  In most cases, a blank,
    comma and equal sign are treated the same.  In some cases, such as in
    the SWITCH command, the equal sign is used for an absolute setting,
    while the blank and comma separate the switches that are set.  The
    number of blanks is arbitrary, but not so for the other delimiters.
    The semi-colon is used to delimit lines of input.  For example, you can
    specify:   SWITCH;SCREEN   to execute the SWITCH and SCREEN command.

    The asterisk is used in many ways, each with a different meaning.  It
    is the wild character in a name mask and represents infinity as a
    numeric value (for both input and output).  The slash is a delimiter
    only for the special case of numeric range specification.  It can be
    used, for example, in a path name in a unix environment.  Two slashes
    are sometimes used to delimit options in some commands.

* This is OBJECTIV.INC, which tests the INCLUDE in rule file OBJECTIV.RUL

 The objective row, named %OBJ, is the total cost to supply and
 transport materials.  Its resident value is %VROWY .
 Its "price" of %VROWP is a convenience to price
 exchanges in each activity. (Note:  if the sense of optimization was
 not %OPT, the price of %OBJ would be %%V ).

               Solvers Recognized by ANALYZE SOLUTION Command

    MINOS is a Modular In-core Nonlinear Optimization System,
          developed by Bruce A. Murtagh and Michael A. Saunders.
          Its copyright is held by Stanford University, and it is
          marketed by Ketron Management Science.

    MPS   can come from IBM's MPSX/370 or Ketron's MPS III or OML.  In
          some environments (eg, SUN), this can come from CPLEX.  This
          file is unformatted (all other solution files are formatted),
          so you might need to use CONVFORT (see Primer) if you are in a
          DOS environment.

    OSL   is the IBM Optimization Software Library.  Its link with
          ANALYZE has been tested on the IBM RISC 6000 under AIX 3.2.
          It is necessary to have the subroutine (in oslsolve.f) to
          generate a solution file from OSL that is recognized by
          ANALYZE.  This is included with ANALYZE (you must have OSL to
          compile it).  See WOODNET.OSL for the structure of the solution
          file (and see the ANALYZE primer).  Also, see oslpck for a more
          efficient interface with OSL.

                       The Output of the RATEOF Command

    The "rate of substitution" is how a basic variable's level must vary
    as a nonbasic variable's level is changed.  These are determined by
    the original equations (constraints and objective row), but with the
    resident solution determining which variables are basic and which
    are nonbasic.

    Algebraically, we have the "fundamental rate equation":

              X(i) = Level(i) + Rate(i,j) x ÎX(j),
              |      |          |           |___ Change in level of
              |Level |          |               j-th nonbasic variable
              | of   |_ Current |_ Rate of
              | i-th    value      substitution
              |basic    of X(i)
              |variable

    The current level of X(i) takes into account that the current levels
    of nonbasic variables, such as X(j), may not be 0.  Note that X(i)
    is driven to one of its bounds, depending upon the sign of the rate
    by which X(j) displaces X(i).  We refer to "blockage" when X(i)
    prevents any further change in X(j) (without crossing its bound).
    In particular, the output of RATEOF gives the "Least" and "Greatest"
    values X(j) could be without driving a basic variable beyond its
    bound.

    The conditional (or current submatrix) determines the set of
    "impulse variables" whose rates of substitution are displayed.
    If the impulse variable is nonbasic, the above equation is applied
    straightforwardly with the "response variable" being the basic ones
    having non-zero rate.  If the impulse variable is basic, the same
    equation applies and that is the rate displayed;  however, the
    interpretation is different.  The meanings of "Least Value" and
    "Greatest Value" displayed also depend on whether the impulse is
    basic or nonbasic.

    For a basic impulse, the "implied range" is the "myopic range"
    determined by finding the extreme values of x(i) subject to the
    fundamental rate equation and the bounds on the nonbasic variables.
    The myopic range is necessary in that the true range (over the entire
    feasible region) must be within the myopic range.  Each basic
    solution gives another re-write of the equations, and different
    variables are nonbasic, so the myopic range is not necessarily a good
    estimate of the true range.  One case where the myopic range gives
    useful information is when it must exceed its explict lower bound (or
    be strictly less than its explicit upper bound).  In this case the
    bound value is redundant -- ie, its removal does not change the set
    of feasible solutions.  (The BASIS REDUND command uses this in its
    determination of redundant constraints.) Another useful case is when
    the implied upper limit of the variable equals its given lower bound.
    In that case, the variable is forced to equal this value in every
    feasible solution.  In particular, a variable might be forced to be
    zero in every feasible solution.

    For a nonbasic impulse, the implied range is determined by a basic
    variable's movement towards one of its bounds.  If no basic variable
    is driven to one of its bound values, the implied range of the
    impulse variable is infinite.  For example, suppose each basic
    variable must simply be non-negative (no upper bound).  Then, a basic
    variable with a positive rate of substitution moves away from its
    bound (ie, its level increases as the impulse variable is increased).
    If this is true for all basic variables, the impulse variable can
    increase its value indefinitely while remaining feasible.  Otherwise,
    if some basic variable has a negative rate of substitution, it is
    driven to zero when the impulse level increases by -X(i)/R(i,j).
    That is, the fundamental rate equation is 0 = X(i) + R(i,j)ÎX(j),
    which has the solution ÎX(j) = -X(i)/R(i,j).  Disallowing any basic
    variable becoming negative imposes the limit:  ÎX(j) <= -X(i)/R(i,j).
    Since this must be true for all i such that R(i,j) < 0, we have the
    upper limit in the range of ÎX(j) = Min[-X(i)/R(i,j): R(i,j) < 0].

    The lower limit is found by considering decreasing the impulse value
    (ie, ÎX(j) < 0) and determining a similar bound, ÎX(j) >=
    Max[-X(i)/R(i,j): R(i,j) > 0].  When a basic variable has other
    bounds, similar expressions give the implied range in order to remain
    feasible.  If one (or both) of these limits is finite, the "blockage"
    is a basic variable that yields the extreme (ie, it is driven to its
    bound before (or same as) the others).

    In the equation format with OBJECTIV specified (after EQUATION),
    in the D or P option, and in the SYNTAX format, objective rates are
    also shown, as "Net rate of" <objective row>.  This shows the effect
    of the rate of substitution on the level of the objective value.  For
    example, suppose we have the equation, A = 10 + 2 B, where A is a
    basic column variable and B is non-basic.  The rate of substituion of
    A with respect to B is 2, which means that if B is increased, A
    increases at the rate of 2 units per unit of B.  If C is the
    objective coefficient of A, this change causes the total objective
    value to increase at the rate of 2 C.

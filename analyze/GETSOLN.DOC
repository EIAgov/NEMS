          Formats and Conventions for Reading a Solution File

    Below are notations on the assumptions used to read recognized
    solution files (MINOS, MPS, and OSL).  The following additional
    convention applies to all solution files.

    It is possible for a free column (ie, no explicit lower or upper
    bounds) to be non-basic.  This can happen if there is
    ill-conditioning, such as linear dependency.  Normally, free columns
    are put into the basis first by an optimizer, so their solution
    status is basic (B).  Otherwise, a column status of F (or FR) can
    appear, which is not recognized by ANALYZE.  The column is changed as
    follows,

        1.  If its reduced cost is >= 0, its lower bound is changed to
        its level and its status is L.

        2.  If its reduced cost is < 0, its upper bound is changed to
        its level and its status is U.

        (These are reversed when sense of optimization is MAX and the
        solution is feasible.)

    What follows is the procedure information for each recognized
    solution file type.

                                    MINOS
                                    ~~~~~
    This is an ASCII file with 128 columns.  Each line that begins with an
    asterisk (*) in column is called a comment line, and it is ignored.
    Blank lines are also ignored.  (Both are counted, however, in giving
    the line count, such as for an error message.)  The following steps
    describe the processing.

    1.  The following keywords are searched (in this order), and the
    subsequent string obtained:
       NAME            problem_name
       STATUS          solution_status
       OBJECTIVE       objective_name  sense_of_optimization
       RHS             rhs_name
       RANGES          range_name
       BOUNDS          bound_name

    Each string is compared with the resident one to verify this is the
    right LP.  For example, the problem name should be the same.  The
    solution status (eg, OPTIMAL) and the sense of optimization (MIN or
    MAX) are not resident, so they are set by the MINOS specification.

    2. If the names are verified, the next searches are for:
       SECTION 1 - ROWS
       NUMBER
    The line with NUMBER is the section header.  This should be one line,
    but this is checked to see if the line was wrapped (creating 2 lines).
    If so, this is indicated and processing is done with 2 lines per row,
    the second containing the dual price.

    3. Finally, the next searches are for:
       SECTION 2 - COLUMNS
       NUMBER
    This is processed the same as the rows section (1 or 2 lines per
    column).

                                     MPS
                                     ~~~
    The MPS solution file is unformatted and is available in limited
    environments (notably, the SUN4).  It can be used to read CPLEX
    solution files (but not in all computing environments).

                                     OSL
                                     ~~~
    An OSL solution file is ASCII and can be created by OSLSOLVE.F, which
    is included in the source code (limited distribution).  It is
    automatically uploaded for the IBM RISC 6000.  The Primer describes
    the formats.

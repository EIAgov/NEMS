                               ANALYZE SWITCHES

    Use HELP SWITCH to see how to set or list the switch values.  You
    can EXECUTE SWITCH0 to set the switches to their initial values
    (and you can edit SWITCH0.EXC to have these values be whatever you
    want, then INCLUDE SWITCH0.EXC in your PROFILE.EXC if you do change
    the original settings.  Here are the switches:

    ECHO_ON.....If on, echos commands on screen (useful when executing
                commands from a file).
    ERR_STOP....If on, aborts terminal I/O when encountering a fatal
                error.
    MSG_ON......If on, gives messages from various commands.

    DISP_COL....If on, displays columns;  if off, displays rows.  This
                switch value changes with a ROW | COL specification in
                any of the DISPLAY command group (ADDRIM, EXPLAIN, RATEOF,
                SHOW, TALLY).
    OPT_MIN.....If on, the sense of optimization is minimization;  if
                off, it is maximization.   This setting affects the
                REDUCE command.
    SYNTAX......If on, syntax is shown with DISPLAY and SHOW commands
                (if available).

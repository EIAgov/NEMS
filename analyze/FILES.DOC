                               ANALYZE FILES

    There are various file types, some give help, others contain data.
    Their location on your disk may depend on a prefix or suffix, which
    can be set with the _SETUP command.  (You may also see the default
    settings by entering the _SETUP command; and, see INCLUDE.DOC.).

    The only mandatory file into ANALYZE is the matrix (MPS) file.

    DICTNARY supports the Dictionary information (?  ...) and one
             may use the _DICTNRY command to load or merge different
             dictionaries.

    EXECUTE  contains commands to EXECUTE.  One special Execute
             file is PROFILE, which enables automatic execution of
             commands upon entering the system (such as screen
             settings).

    HELP     supports the online HELP command.  There is a file for
             every command and for a general introduction.

    INCLUDE  enables INCLUDE files referenced from an input data file.

    KEYWORD  supports the _KEYWORD command with keys defined of the
             form:  key := text (no keywords are in ANALYZE, but you
             can define some, such as for specs used by MINOS).

    OUTPUT   supports the OUTPUT command.

    PRINT    supports added online help by documenting aspects of
             the system, such as this document on file types.

                                ANALYZE

    BLOCK    supports LOAD and SAVE in the BLOCK command.  It is a
             binary file.  (The SUBMAT command level can be used
             for transportable files.)

    FORMAT   is a formatted version of the PACKED file, which is
             used when changing the computing environment, such as
             downloading from a mainframe to a pc.

    GRAPH    is a graph file (see GRAPH command).

    IIS      specifies an Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem
             produced by John Chinneck's code, MINOS(IIS).

    MATRIX   is a representation of the linear program, which is a
             (de facto) standard form of input to an optimizer.

    MINOS    is a solution file from MINOS.

    MPS      is a solution file from MPSX/370 or MPSIII.  This is
             functional in a TSO or CMS environment, but it may be
             used for other environments, such as a CPLEX solution
             file on a SUN 4 (not in DOS versions).

    OSL      is a solution file from OSL.  It is assumed the file
             was generated by the subroutine in OSLSOLVE.F (which
             is in ANALSUBS.ARC).  Installation of OSLSOLVE.F is
             automatic for the AIX environment, but it requires
             manual loading for other environments (not supported
             under DOS environment).

    PACKED   is a binary file of the internal lists, which is
             created after reading in a matrix (perhaps also a
             solution).  It supports READIN and WRITEOUT commands,
             which are the same as LOAD (or RESTORE) and SAVE.
             Typically, for large problems, a matrix and solution are
             READIN as part of the batch job, then saved as a packed
             file to reduce the time it takes during an interactive
             session with ANALYZE.

    RULEBASE enables the INTERPRT command and names the rule files
             for instantiation.

    SCHEMA   is a binary file saved or loaded by the SCHEMA command.

    SUBMAT   is created by SUBMAT SAVE.  It is an execution file to
             recreate a submatrix by a series of SUBMAT ADD
             commands.  (The BLOCK command should be used for large
             submatrices, because it saves and loads binary files.)

    SYNTAX   supports the EXPLAIN, SCHEMA, SYNTAX and TABLE commands
             plus the syntax output from other commands, notably GRAPH.

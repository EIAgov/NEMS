                SETUP ASSOCIATED WITH START-UP PROCESS

 This is to explain the use of keyworded files for initializing the
 session.  ANALYZE looks for the following files (in order).

   SETUP.EXC
      If this exists, it sets prefixes and suffixes for the intrinsic
      filetypes given in _SETUP.

                                 NOTE
 All files below are sought with the default prefix and suffix, which
 may have been changed by SETUP.EXC.

   CREDITS.DOC
      If this exists, it is printed before the sign-on.  You may delete
      or rename it to suppress printing at every session.

   RULBASE.RUL
      If this exists, it defines the options in the INTERPRT command.
      Each entry is a rule file name (1 line @), and the file's
      existance is tested before it is added as an option.

   ANALYZE.DIC
      This loads the standard ANALYZE dictionary (see others, like KEYS).

   ANALYZE.KEY
      This loads the standard ANALYZE keywords (see KEYS.DIC).

   PROFILE.EXC
      If this exists, it executes the commands in it.  This is where one can
      set strings (for simple abbreviations of common specifications), screen
      width/length, readin an LP, give message to user, etc.

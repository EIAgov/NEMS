              Input/Output Structures (IO option of SHOW command)

    The IO structure is given in GRAPH.DOC, but here we define it in terms
    of factors.

    Price (row)    factor =  A(i,j)X(j)  (Y = sum of factors).
    Level (column) factor = -P(i)A(i,j)  (D = sum of factors).
    Note:  P(obj) = -1 for minimization, so it is a factor if A(i,j) <> 0,
           and other free rows have P=0, so they are not factors.

    A column's inputs are rows with negative price factors, and its
    outputs are rows with positive price factors.

          |-|  P > 0  ===>  input  (factor > 0)
          |-|  P < 0  ===>  output (factor < 0)
          |.|
          |+|  P > 0  ===>  output (factor < 0)
          |+|  P < 0  ===>  input  (factor > 0)
          |_|
           D = sum of price factors = Sum{-P(i)A(i,j): i}.

    A row's inputs are columns with negative level factors, and its
    outputs are columns with positive level factors.

                  X > 0 ===> output (factor > 0)
                  X < 0 ===> input  (factor < 0)
                  =====
    [-    -  ...  +   +]     Y = sum of level factors = Sum{A(i,j)X(j):j}
     ======
     X > 0 ===> input  (factor < 0)
     X < 0 ===> output (factor > 0)

                Infeasible Instances of a Blending Model

    These comprise a collection of blending model infeasible instances.
    Their names are BLENDCAP, BLENDDEM, BLENDINF, BLENDOMT, BLENDREV,
    and BLENDSUP.  For each instance, there are the following files.

         name.MAT  matrix file (created by MODLER)
         name.MNS  solution file (created by MINOS)
         name.IIS  IIS (created by John Chinneck's code)

    If you executed MOREDATA after loading the files in this library,
    you will have name.PCK for each of the six instances.  Otherwise,
    you should first execute the following commands for each instance.

             READ MAT name ; SOL MINOS name ; BASIS ;  WRITE name

               * Note that name is used for the I/O commands. *

    The WRITE command creates the packed file on your disk after setting
    up the basis (to use the RATEOF command).

    To analyze these instances, read their packed files (at the ANALYZE
    prompt enter:  READ P name).  The syntax file is BLENDINF.SYN for
    all instances, so to read the syntax, enter READ SYN BLEND (use
    _SETUP if necessary to set your default prefix and suffix to where
    this is stored).

    Enter READ I name to read the IIS file.  For example, READ I BLENCAP
    to read the IIS file, BLENDCAP.IIS, for the infeasible instance,
    BLENDCAP.

    My analysis approach is in BLENDINF.EXC, which produces a report in
    BLENDINF.RPT (execute this after doing your own analysis).

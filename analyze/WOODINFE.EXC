$ WOODINFE.....an infeasible network problem.
$  Try to diagnose the cause of infeasibility by first
$  isolating a relevant portion of the model instance.
$  Ultimately, you want to answer, "Why is this infeasible?"
$  to someone who does not know LP.  Use the EXPLAIN command
$  to put your explanation into English.  As a last resort use
$  the REDUCE command, which should reveal the problem.

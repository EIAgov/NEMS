                          Setting up some Exercises

     After you have tested ANALYZE, you can run through the exercises.
     I suggest you do this to become more familiar with ANALYZE,
     especially its RULEBASE facility supporting the INTERPRT command.

     In your ANALYZE path, copy EXERCISE.EXC PROFILE.EXC  Then, enter
     ANALYZE and follow the instructions.

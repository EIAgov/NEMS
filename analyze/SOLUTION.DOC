                          The Meaning of a Solution

    A solution (x, y) is feasible if y=Ax and L <= (x,y) <= U, where L
    and U are the explicit bounds.  We do not rule out the possibility of
    no bound on some variable, so we allow U to be infinity (denoted by *
    in ANALYZE displays), and L to be minus infinity (denoted by -*).

    Associated with a solution (feasible or not) is a vector of dual
    prices, (d, p), where d = c - pA.  The c vector is the objective
    coefficients of x.  Note that d is the same dimension as x, which is
    the number of columns of A, and p is the same dimension as y, which
    is the number of rows of A.  This dual solution is feasible if the
    following conditions are satisfied:

                d(j) >= 0 for j such that L(j) is finite;
                d(j) <= 0 for j such that U(j) is finite;
                p(i) >= 0 for i such that L(i) is finite;
                p(i) <= 0 for i such that U(i) is finite.

    These feasibility conditions are for minimization.  If the LP is a
    maximization, reverse the sign constraints on the dual variables.

    A complete solution is all 4 vectors:  (x, y, d, p), which can be
    expressed algebraically or combinatorially, as we describe below.
    If the solution is optimal, this means both the primal and dual
    solutions are feasible.  In this case, we also have:

      x(j) > L(j) implies d(j) = 0  and  d(j) > 0 implies x(j) = L(j);
      x(j) < U(j) implies d(j) = 0  and  d(j) < 0 implies x(j) = U(j);
      y(i) > L(i) implies p(i) = 0  and  p(i) > 0 implies y(i) = L(i);
      y(i) < U(i) implies p(i) = 0  and  p(i) < 0 implies y(i) = U(i).

    In LP, these are called "complementary slackness conditions".

    In general, it is possible to have both the level and price of a
    complementary pair equal to their bound value.  For example, we could
    have x(j)=L(j) and d(j)=0.  When this occurs, the solution is said to be
    "degenerate".  It is primal degenerate if the primal level (x or y) is
    at its bound value but basic.  It is dual degenerate if the dual price
    (d or p) is zero but the primal variable is non-basic.  If no
    complementary pair is degenerate, the solution is said to be "strictly
    complementary."  In that case, either the primal level is strictly
    between its bounds or the associated dual price is strictly positive.

    Central to an LP solution is a combinatorial description, as follows.
    Exactly m of the variables will be called basic, where m is the
    number of equations (rows of A).  Each variable has a status value:

                Basic and feasible, denoted by B
                Basic and infeasible, denoted by I
                Nonbasic at lower bound, denoted by L
                Nonbasic at upper bound, denoted by U.

    Suppose Y is the subvector of (x, y) composed of the m basic
    variables, and X is the vector of nonbasic variables.  With some
    arithmetic, the equations are equivalent to Y = Y0 - M X, where M is
    a matrix derived from A for the particular basis and Y0 depends on
    this basis and the bounds on the original y-variables.

    Each nonbasic variable has its level equal to the specified bound, so
    X is completely determined by its status (L or U).  Once X is fixed,
    Y becomes fixed.  This means that the combinatorial description --
    ie, the status of each variable -- is enough to determine the
    solution values.  This applies to dual values as well.

    It may be that x(j) = L(j), but the Status of x(j) is Basic.  This is
    known as degeneracy, and it typically occurs.  In this case, knowing
    the status is still enough to determine unique values, but not
    conversely.  Knowing x(j)=L(j) does not imply with certainty that the
    status of x(j) is L (nonbasic at lower bound); it could still be
    basic.

    In summary, each variable (y, or row variable, and x, or column
    variable) has the following solution information associated with it.

      Combinatorial:
          Status.........B,I,L,U
                         : : : :...Nonbasic at upper bound (Level=U)
                         : : :...Nonbasic at lower bound (Level=L)
                         : :...Basic and infeasible (violates a bound)
                         :...Basic and feasible (within bounds)
      Algebraic:
          Level..........X for column, Y for row (Y = AX)
          Price..........D for column, P for row (D = C - PA)
                         :...sometimes called reduced cost

    The combinatorial solution description uniquely determines the
    algebraic values, but not necessarily conversely.

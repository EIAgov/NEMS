                          A Guide to Learning ANALYZE

    The outline below is a guide to how you might use the online
    documentation (see the User's Guide, given in ANALYZE.REF, for more
    guidance).

     1. Basic Terms and Concepts
       1.1 Enter ? to see a general introduction
       1.2 PRINT MENU and QUICKREF for an overview of the commands
       1.3 PRINT CONDNL and practice with some simple query commands
           (follow Chapter 3 in the User's Guide)
       1.4 PRINT SETUP and FILES to understand basic inputs and outputs

     2. Learning to Query
       2.1 PRINT DIRMATS and examine some LPs, beginning with reading
           one into memory
       2.2 Use DISPLAY, ADDRIM, and SHOW commands
       2.3 Use COUNT, LIST, PICTURE and SHOW //ARRAY commands
       2.4 Repeat 2&3, varying the output format options (use HELP to see
           the options)
       2.5 Repeat 2-4, using the SUBMAT command both directly and in
           its subcommand level

    3. Learning Syntax
      3.1 PRINT SYNTAX
      3.2 Read in the syntax and use the SCHEMA and SYNTAX commands,
          varying the options
      3.3 Repeat 2.2-5 with the SYNTAX switch on and/or with SYNTAX
          specified as a command option
      3.4 Use the TALLY command
      3.5 Use the BLOCK COL SYNTAX and BLOCK ROW SYNTAX commands

    4. Learning Rates of Substitution
      4.1 PRINT RATEOF
      4.2 Use the RATEOF command, varying the options
      4.3 Use the BASIS PIVOT command to perform pivots and use
          EXEC RATETAB to see the effects

    5. Learning to use the Basis
      5.1 Specify BASIS for each of several LPs, and PRINT GALGRTHM
          to see the meaning of the sections (FTRI, Kernel, BTRI)
      5.2 Use the BASIS CHECK and BASIS REFRESH commands to see
          what the numerical accuracy is like.  (Use the _KEYWORD command
          to display and change interrupts and tolerances.) Also, compare
          the latter with the VERIFY command
      5.3 Use the BASIS ADD command to examine basic sections and spikes
      5.4 Use the BASIS REDUND command to see how the basis can reveal
          redundant constraints

    6. See the User's Guide and PRINT ANALYZE.REF for more information.

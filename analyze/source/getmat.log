  The GETMAT module is a self-contained set of subroutines that gives access
  to matrix and solution.  The file GETIO reads in matrix, solution or
  "packed" files.  The subroutines in file GETLIB give access, and GETSET
  initializes (see listings for more information).  The files GREDUCE and
  GBASIS are special.  The routines in GREDUCE perform reduction and those
  in GBASIS perform transformations (by the resident basis); they are
  included in the GETMAT module because they access the data structure
  (i.e., DCGETMAT).

  The object files for DOS were compiled with Lahey FORTRAN.

  See GETDATA.DOC and GALGRTHM.DOC for details about the data structure and
  the algorithms, respectively.

  BEGIN 12.4
  > Allow degenerate pivot (in GBRANGE.FOR).
  > Added some checks in GUPCKGEN.FOR.
  > Added check in GPUTSL (GETSET.FOR)
  > Fixed bug in GPIVOT (GBRANGE.FOR)
  > Fixed buts in GNEWLP (GETSET.FOR) and GUPCKC (GUPCKGEN.FOR), as
    for Joe Creegan's problem
  > Changed GRDFPK and GWRFPK (GETIOPCK.FOR) to read and write double
    precision values.
  BEGIN 12.5
  > Added ED* stats (values in BASE changes DCGETMAT)...affects
     GETSET.FOR:  GNEWLP, GETEDS (new)
     GETEDIT.FOR: GETFRE, GETFIX, GROUND, GRENAM
     GETRANS.FOR: GBREFR
     GREDMAT.FOR: REDBND
  > Changed CLAHEY dimensions in DCGETMAT
  > Added GVERFY to GETRANS.FOR
  > Added VTSUM and other changes to GRED*.FOR
  > Added GPUTBS to GETSET.FOR (7-5-95)
  > Added NAMELN to GETMAT calling args (7-17-95)
  > Added recognition of line truncation in minos solution file
    (GETIOSOL.FOR ... FORMAT=MINOS)
  > REMOVED OB1 FROM GETIOSOL (saved in GETOB1.FOR)
    ...only ANALYZE code changed:  ARDSOL in AREADIN.FOR
      (LPRENAME & RANDMOD use same routine)
  > Enhanced oslpck.f to read any matrix file (binary or formatted) or
    a model file...see oslpck.DOC.
  > Cosmetic changes in REDCOL.
  > Removed GPUTBS (see HOLD) and moved BASCLR to GETSET (for LPRENAME).

  8-3-95 BEGIN ANALYZE 12.6
  > Added SWREPL to calling args of GBREFR (in GETRANS.FOR), and to those
    of GUPCKW (in GUPCKGEN.FOR).  This affects oslanal.f and the OML
    interface.
  > Created GBRVER.FOR
  > Changed calling args of GPIVOT (in GBRANGE.FOR)
  > Removed SWREPL from GBREFR and told Joe Creegan to omit calling
    GBREFR in GUPCKW (which was done here).
  8-15-95  BEGIN ANALYZE 13.0
  > Created GREDTEST.FOR and changed calling args to REDUCE.
  > Created DCREDUCE and restructured FOR files (moving routines around)

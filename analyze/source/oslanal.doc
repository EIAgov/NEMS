                  oslanal: An OSL-ANALYZE Interface Utility

   The oslanal Fortran program is an interface that reads either a matrix
   (mps) file, such as saved by the osl routine EKKBCDO, or a model file,
   as saved by the osl routine EKKPTMD.  This program will read the file
   either by EKKMPS or EKKGTMD, respectively.  Then, this program will
   solve the LP using osl routines (see source code).  The output of
   oslanal is a binary packed file for input to ANALYZE, which contains
   the LP matrix + solution values.

   After the file name, you are prompted for file type (MATRIX or MODEL).
   The packed file will be given a default name (with .PCK suffix), and a
   prompt to enable you to change it.

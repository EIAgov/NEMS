SUBMATRIX DICTIONARY (initialized by ASUBMAT...called by SYSIN)

 For conditional parsing....
    RIMKEY(1,.) = L, U, C, Y, P   (for ROWS)
    RIMKEY(2,.) = L, U, C, X, D   (for COLS)
    OPLIST = LE, LT, EQ, NE, GT, GE
    KEY1 OPKEY KEY2  is relational condition (up to 8 in one conditional)

    NOPKEY  = number of relational conditions (<= MAXOPS)
    MAXOPS  = max number of relational conditions = 8
    NKEYS   = number of rim keys = 5
    NOPLST  = number of relational operators = 6

    NZLO    = lower value of number of nonzeroes
    NZUP    = upper value of number of nonzeroes
    VLO     = lower value of rim values in conditional
    VUP     = upper value of rim values in conditional

    SOLMAP = solution status map to delineate LUBI

    SWSBNZ = switch to tell if nonzeroes have been tallied

 Submatrix statistics...
    NZSUB  = number of nonzeroes
    NRCSUB = number of rows/columns

    VSUMSB = sum of rim values for row/column (* excluded)
    VMINSB = min of rim values for row/column (* excluded)
    VMAXSB = max of rim values for row/column (* excluded)
    VAVGSB = average of rim values for row/column (* excluded)

Submatrix Ordering (for PICTURE and rulebase)...not presently used.

 ORDER holds row+column indexes
 ...MAXORD MUST BE AT LEAST THE NUMBER OF ROWS + COLUMNS IN SUBMATRIX
    ORDKEY = 0 means unordered
           = 1 means LOWER triangular-seeking
           = 2 means UPPER triangular-seeking
           = 3 means SYNTAX match-seeking

Files:  DATFIL = Unit number for data (card image)
        PCKFIL = Unit number for packed file (unformatted)
        NAMLEN = Max number of characters in name of file

 Array ZVALUE is needed for ftran, etc.
 Arrays ROWLST||VALLST hold sparse column (retrieved from GETCOL)
 Array SCRIND/SCRVAL is scratch (multi-purpose), and its length must be at
 least equal to the number of rows.

 TRPOS and TRNEG are for the trace routine;  they hold number of positive and
 number of negative coefficients in each row.

                               Block Dictionary
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    BNAME (I) = name of block I
    BMASK (I) = mask of names in block I
    BNUMBR(I) = number of rows/columns in block I
    BINDEX(K) = block number of row/col (K=1,...,NROWS+NCOLS)
                ...= 0 if K is not in any block
    NRBLKS    = number of row blocks
    NCBLKS    = number of column blocks
    MAXBLK    = max number of blocks                \
    MXBIND    = length of BINDEX (>= NROWS + NCOLS) /   (set in BLINIT

 DATA STRUCTURE HAS POOLED LISTS (BNAME,BMASK,BNUMBR), GROWING
   TOWARDS EACH OTHER...ROWS GO FROM 1 TO NRBLKS AND COLS GO FROM
   MAXBLK TO MAXBLK - NCBLKS + 1

                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    EXTABL holds entity and syntax tables
    EXKEY  holds 8-character key (translation of EXKEY(I) is EXTABL(I))
    EXCHAR is special character for "wildcard" translation (set in EXPINT)

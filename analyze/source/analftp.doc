   To get ANALYZE via FTP, do the following.

   1. FTP crane.denver.colorado.edu (if this fails, try FTP 132.194.30.30).
   Once you get the login prompt, your userid and password are both analyze
   (note lower case).

   2. First, enter:  get takeanal.ftp takeanal.ftp
                     get takedata.ftp takedata.ftp
   These are take files.  The first takes source code;  the second takes
   data (including the moredata library).
   Now enter:   take takeanal.ftp
                take takedata.ftp
   After these are done, quit ftp and return to your home computer.

   3. If you are in unix, execute the script file, makeanal.s (you might
   have to chmod).  Otherwise, use these script files to write your own
   command file.  Now ANALYZE has been compiled and linked, and your
   executable is called ANALYZE (or ANALYZE.EXE).

   4. Enter ANALYZE and test it by EXEC ATEST (if this is your first time,
   you should also EXEC BIGTEST to be sure all is well).  You can also
   EXEC MOREDATA to setup the moredata files (or just for more testing).

   If all is well, please remove the source codes by entering:  rm *.f and
   rm DC*.  (If you are not in unix, replace the rm command with delete, or
   whatever.)  As described in README.ANL, you have agreed not to make the
   source code available to anyone.  Just in case you need to re-compile
   (say for larger dimensions), you may copy the source files to a disk and
   store it in a safe place, so no one else can get it.

   If you have any problems, please contact the author:

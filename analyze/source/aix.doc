    This describes the FTP files, which I use to transfer files from the
    VAX to the RISC/6000.  The script files are also described here.

    TAKEANAL.FTP  is a take file that puts the source codes (*.f),
                  include files (DC*), and relevant script files (*.s).
    TAKEDATA.FTP  is a take file that puts the data files.
    TAKEMORE.FTP  is a take file that puts the data files from the
                  MOREDATA library.

    These are not needed if you are happy with the standard ANALYZE
    executable.

    Script files:
       CHMODATA.S  chmod +x for the other script files for data.
       CHMODFOR.S  chmod +x for the other script files for source.
       COMPFLIP.S  compile flip source codes.
       COMPANAL.S  compile analyze source codes (other than flip).
       LINKANAL.S  link analyze.
       LOADANAL.S  load analyze source codes from DOS diskette.
       MAKEANAL.S  compile (including flip) and link analyze.
       OSLSOLVE.S  use osl to solve an LP (you must make oslsolve).
       OSLCOMP.S   compile and link oslsolve.f (you must have osl) to
                   make the executable, oslsolve.
       RSDISTR.S   copy data and executable for distribution.

    If you use SETANAL VAX, you will have the AIX files, except !AIX.HLP
    is renamed to AIX.HLP (this is to avoid a problem with the ! in upload).
    However, the auto edits are not identical.  In particular, FLIPMGT.FOR
    and RBSTACKS.FOR contain CIAIX edits you should perform (either with
    the vi editor or before upload).  These edits enable the system command
    !AIX from within ANALYZE.  The VAX does not have this capability.

    If you use SETANAL AIX, you will have what you need for the RISC
    environment, but the !AIX command will not work under VAX/VMS, so do not
    try to make ANALYZE with this setup unless you are doing it for the
    RISC alone.  Also, !AIX.HLP was not renamed, so you must do this to use
    the take files (see TAKEANAL.FTP).

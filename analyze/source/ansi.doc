      The ANSI Fortran/77 standard is followed in most ways.  Here are
      some exceptions.

      1.  Many routines have local variables and arguments that are
      declared LOGICAL*1.  This can be changed to LOGICAL, but it must
      be done in all subroutines and in the include files, DC*.

      2.  In some applications, long arrays of integers are
      equivalenced to a short integer array, declared INTEGER*2.
      THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED (contact Harvey Greenberg if you need to
      do this).

      If you find any other deviations from ANSI standard, please
      report them.

    A schema may be read in to allow versatile links with other modeling
    languages and systems.  The formatted file structure for the SCHEMA
    READ command is as follows.

    Any line with an astrisk (*) in column 1 is ignored (may be for
    comments).  Blank lines are also ignored.  The other lines, called
    active, are as follows.

         Line 1:  number of row strips     number of column strips
                  ...in 2I5 format

    Each of the remaining (active) lines is a name with 1 to 16
    characters and begins in column 1.  Suppose r=number of row strips,
    and c=number of column strips.

         Line i:  row strip        (for i=2,...,r+1)
         Line j:  column strip     (for j=r+2,...,r+c+1)
         Line k:  data entry       (for k=r+c+2,...,r+c+1+rc)
                ...looping over i outside j

    Example schema:
                           C1   C2   C3
                       R1  11   12   13
                       R2  21   22   23

                   ______________________

    Note:  If making a schema file just to give the table in some
           other environment like ANALYZE, consider simply the SCHEMA
           DISPLAY to a (formatted) file.  Then, the PRINT command could
           be used.  The user could be informed of this by the dictionary
           or by a document file associated with general help provided
           for the model and its instances.

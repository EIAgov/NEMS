    Solution Status Keys for Each Row and Column are:  B, L, U and I.  The
    resident solution could be basic and/or strictly complementary.  We
    first elabaroate on the keys when the solution is basic, then when it
    is strictly complementary.

    If the resident solution is basic, B=Basic and feasible; L=Nonbasic at
    lower bound; U=Nonbasic at upper bound; I=Infeasible (and basic).  A
    basic partition of y=Ax is as follows (dual prices assume minimum):

      Stat of column j:     B         I          L      U
                       -------------------------------------
                       L<=X<=U    L>X  or X>U   X=L    X=U
                          D=0    &D=-1   &D=1   D>=0   D<=0
                       -------------------------------------
    Stat of row i = L     ALB        ALI        ALL    ALU      Y=L,  P>=0
    Stat of row i = U     AUB        AUI        AUL    AUU      Y=U,  P<=0
    Stat of row i = B     ABB        ABI        ABL    ABU   L<=Y<=U, P =0
    Stat of row i = I     AIB        AIB        AIL    AIU   L>Y  or Y>U
                                                            &P=-1   &P=1
                       -------------------------------------

    The basis kernel is the submatrix:

                          ALB  ALI
                          AUB  AUI

    which is used to give the rates of substitution (with the RATEOF
    command).

    If the resident solution is not basic, but it is strictly
    complementary, then it is optimal.  In that case, the partition is as
    follows (note the strict inequalities):

      Stat of column j:    B         U        L
                       --------------------------
                       L < X < U   X = U    X = L
                           D = 0   D < 0    D > 0
                       --------------------------
    Stat of row i = L     ALB       ALU      ALL      Y = L,  P > 0 \ Active
    Stat of row i = U     AUB       AUU      AUL      Y = U,  P < 0 / Rows
    Stat of row i = B     ABB       ABU      ABL  L < Y < U,  P = 0
                       --------------------------
                       <---- Active ---->
                             Columns

    This partition is unique (i.e., every strictly complementary solution
    has the same partition into active and inactive rows and columns).
    For notational simplicity in the use of an optimal partition for
    postoptimal sensitivity analysis, array displays appear as follows:

        B  N  <--- Active rows (Stat=L or U)
        B* N* <--- Inactive rows (Stat=B)
        |  |
        |  `--- Inactive columns (Stat=L)
        `-- Active columns (Stat=B or U)

    The status keys are determined by the optimizer.

    More generally, you can use the STRING command to define a partition
    based on STATUS and solution values.  For example, you can specify the
    following:

    STRING EPS=.000001
    STRING XB = STAT=B D=0
    STRING XL = STAT=L D='EPS /*
    STRING XU = STAT=U D=-*/-'EPS
    STRING YB = STAT=B P=0
    STRING YL = STAT=L P GT C
    STRING YU = STAT=U P LT C

    Then, if you want the submatrix composed of active columns and active
    rows, you would specify:

    SUBMAT COL 'XB ; SUBMAT ADD COL 'XU
    SUBMAT ROW 'YL ; SUBMAT ADD ROW 'YU

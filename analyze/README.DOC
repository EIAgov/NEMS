              Summary of ANALYZE Enhancements for Version 13.0
                    Since November 1994 (Version 12.4)
                 Latest User's Guide is for version 13.0

   1. Added WIDTH option to RATEOF //TABLEAU.
   2. Expanded output of BASIS REFRESH command.
   3. Added edit info to SUMMARY command (see SUMMARY.HLP).
   4. Increased dimensions for DOS version to accommodate 2,000 rows and
      8,000 columns (more disk space needed to hold EXE).
   5. Added VERIFY command (see VERIFY.HLP).
   6. Enhanced interfaces with GAMS, MINOS and OSL (eliminated OB1
      solution file type).  These are mostly in the utilities, LPRENAME
      and oslanal.
   7. Recognition of commands and keywords is now case insensitive (other
      entries remains case sensitive, such as file names and LP names).
   8. Added IO option to SHOW command (see SHOW.HLP).
   9. Added TIME interrupt parameter to commands that could take significant
      time, such as BASIS CHECK and REDUCE.
  10. Added NOCHANGE option to BASIS REFRESH.  (Note: this affects the GUPCK
      utility, used for an in-core setup.)
  11. Added keywords, used as global settings for command options.  In
      particular, TIME, FREQUENCY, and tolerances used in the solution
      verification commands:  BASIS CHECK, BASIS REFRESH, and VERIFY.  This
      also makes REDUCE tolerances accessible.  (See help files, ANALYZE.KEY
      and KEYS.DIC.)
  12. Other enhancements were made to the three solution verification
      commands, including enhanced output from BASIS CHECK and BASIS
      REFRESH, and more options were added to REDUCE.
  13. Added some document files (see DIRDOCS), and majorly revised User's
      Guide.

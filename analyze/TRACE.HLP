  Function: Trace flow, starting with submatrix
  Syntax:   TRACE [row_conditional [,column_conditional] [//specs]
            where specs can be:
              MAXSUB=number ....specifies max size of submatrix
                             (= number of rows = number of columns)

   If conditionals are absent, current submatrix is used; otherwise,
   new submatrix is determined by direct delineation by conditionals.

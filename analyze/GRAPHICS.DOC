                              ANALYZE Graphics

    ANALYZE has graphics (in video text) with the following commands.

       BLOCK....PLOT option of ROW | COL gives bar graph of blocks,
                where heights are numbers in blocks.  For example,
                suppose we have executed the BLOCK NET command to
                determine a maximal embedded netform, with blocks
                named NET.PROD, NET.TRANS, and NET.CONS.  Suppose
                these have 100, 500, and 50 columns, respectively.
                Then, enter:

                BLOCK COL PLOT

                and the result will look something like this (scaled
                differently):

                NUMBER|                500
                      |               .--------.
                      |               |        |
                      |               |        |
                      |               |        |
                      |               |        |
                      |               |        |
                      |               |        |
                      |    100        |        |
                      |   .--------.  |        |   50
                      |   |        |  |        |  .--------.
                      |   |        |  |        |  |        |
                      `---`--------'--`--------'--`--------'-- COL
                           NET.PROD    NET.TRAN    NET.CONS

       GRAPH....gives diagrammatic graph of rows or
                columns in submatrix (see GRAPH.DOC).
       SHOW.....PLOT option gives step function of submatrix columns
                over each submatrix row.  A step has the form,

                    .----------------
                    |
                 ---'

                The height of each step is the coefficient value in
                the row;  the width of each step is the range of the
                activity level.  For example, suppose the submatrix
                row is the objective and the submatrix columns are
                production activities.  Then, the step function shows
                how much supply (width) can be produced for each price
                (height) if one assumes production occurs if, the
                price is greater than the cost (objective value).

                The width is affected with the BY option (see SHOW.HLP).

    Each graphic has the form options:  GRAPHIC or PRINTABL.  The GRAPHIC
    option is the default and looks best on the screen.  The PRINTABL
    option uses only ASCII characters that prints with any printer (the
    GRAPHIC form may not print, depending on your printer, but most word
    processors can accept its form).

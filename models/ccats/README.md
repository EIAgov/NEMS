# CCATS Module
Carbon Capture, Allocation, Transport and Storage Module

## Documentation
CCATS documentation is written in Sphinx.
All associated files will be located in models/ccats/docs.

Two versions of the documentation are currently accessible outside of the repository:
- Stable: file://fs-f3/OEA/IIEA/CO2/CTUS/Development/6_Documentation/stable/html/index.html
- In development: file:///L:/mid/jab/git/NEMS/models/ccats/docs/build/html/index.html

Note: External web access is needed to render the math syntax, therefore the model formulation will not be readable on nem3.

FILE NAME:     RSTKEFF
DATE MODIFIED: July 11, 2024
USED BY:       RDSTEFF subroutine of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) Residential Demand Module (RDM)
DEFINITION:    Average efficiencies of existing RECS-year equipment surviving from the initial RECS stock in each projection year
UNITS:         Same units as shown in RSCLASS tab of RSMESS.xlsx
DIMENSION:     year, equipment class (same as those listed in RSCLASS)
SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS:  non-negative values
ORGANIZATION OF DATA:
               Data starts on row 21 of this file as per RDM convention
               First data year is RECSYEAR
               Variable: STKEFF (same as xlRTBASEFF in RSMESS)

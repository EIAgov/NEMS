FILE NAME:     RSEFF01
DATE MODIFIED: July 11, 2024
USED BY:       RDEFF subroutine of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) Residential Demand Module (RDM)
DEFINITION:    Average efficiencies of existing RECS-year equipment expected to retire from the initial RECS stock in each projection year
UNITS:         Same units as shown in RSCLASS tab of RSMESS.xlsx
DIMENSION:     year, equipment class (same as RSCLASS tab of RSMESS.xlsx)
SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS:  non-negative values
ORGANIZATION OF DATA:
               Data starts on row 21 of this file as per RDM convention
               First data year is RECSYEAR+1
               Variable: EQCEFF (same as xlRTBASEFF in RSMESS)

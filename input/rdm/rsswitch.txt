USED BY:       RSSWITCHREAD subroutine of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) Residential Demand Module (RDM)
DEFINITION:    Residential fuel switching parameters for end uses that cross fuels
UNITS:         Various
DIMENSION:     Various
SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS:  Data starts on row 21 of this file as per RDM convention.
ORGANIZATION OF DATA:
               Variables: RTFCBIAS, RPINSCOST
               Bias parameters columns sorted by 9 census divisions; rows correspond to 11 heating/ 4 cooling equipment classes (RTCLEQCL from RSCLASS.txt; excludes Room AC);
                each block of 11 rows corresponds to each of the 3 building types
               Fuel switching costs matrix arranged with same heating, cooling, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying end uses along columns and rows

USED BY:        COMFloorspace subroutine of the National Energy Modeling System
                (NEMS) Commercial Demand Module (CDM)

DEFINITION:     Building survival parameters

                The median lifetimes and gammas (logistic function parameters)
                used to determine proportion of original stock of a particular
                building type that still exists after a given number of years.

UNITS:          unitless

DIMENSION:      function of time for each building type

SPECIAL CONSTRAINTS:    None

ORGANIZATION OF DATA:

                Data starts on row 101 of this file as per CDM convention.
                
                The first row of data contains values for median building
		lifetimes, and the second row of data contains values for
		the corresponding gammas.  Values within each row are in order
		of building type, in the following order:  Assembly, Education,
		Food Sales, Food Service, Health Care, Lodging, Large Office,
                Small Office, Merc/Service, Warehouse, and Other.
